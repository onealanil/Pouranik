## 🌟 What's Pouranik?

**Pouranik** is an open-source book exploration and reading habit platform designed for people who believe books are more than just words, they’re experiences.
Whether you love self-help, fantasy, biographies, technology, or ancient literature, **Pouranik** is your place to connect with stories and people who share your passion..

## 💡 Why the name **"Pouranik"**?

The word **Paurāṇika** comes from Sanskrit, meaning **ancient, mythical, or timeless.**

We chose this name because stories, whether from ancient scriptures or modern fiction, are timeless.  
**Pouranik** is built on that idea: to help people connect with the magic of reading, share thoughts, and grow together through books.
